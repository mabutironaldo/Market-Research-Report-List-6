<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Long Lasting Hair Color Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Permanent Type</li><li>Semi-permanent Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The long-lasting hair color market includes two main types: permanent and semi-permanent. Permanent hair color provides a durable solution that penetrates the hair shaft, offering enduring coverage and vibrant results that can last until new growth appears.

Both types cater to different consumer needsâ€”from those seeking a lasting change to those preferring temporary enhancements.</p></p>
