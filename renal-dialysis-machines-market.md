<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Renal Dialysis Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The renal dialysis machines market is primarily divided into two types: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis machines filter blood through an external device, utilizing a dialyzer to remove toxins, excess fluid, and electrolytes. This process typically requires patients to visit dialysis centers multiple times a week. In contrast, peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of the abdominal cavity to filter blood, allowing for more flexibility and often enabling patients to perform treatments at home. Both methods cater to different patient needs and lifestyles.</p></p>
