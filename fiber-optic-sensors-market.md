<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Optic Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrinsic Fiber-Optic Sensors</li><li>Extrinsic Fiber-Optic Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fiber optic sensors market is primarily divided into two types: intrinsic and extrinsic fiber-optic sensors. Intrinsic fiber-optic sensors utilize the fiber itself to detect changes in environmental conditions, such as temperature or pressure, based on light changes occurring within the fiber. In contrast, extrinsic fiber-optic sensors involve external components that interact with the fiber to measure variables like displacement or strain, providing enhanced sensitivity and accuracy. Both types find applications in industrial, medical, and structural monitoring sectors.</p></p>
