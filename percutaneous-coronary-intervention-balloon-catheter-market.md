<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Balloon Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi Compliant</li><li>Non Compliant</li><li>Compliant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) balloon catheter market comprises three main types: semi-compliant, non-compliant, and compliant balloons. Semi-compliant balloons expand under pressure but retain some elasticity, adapting to the vessel shape while providing sufficient dilatation. Non-compliant balloons do not expand significantly beyond their nominal size, ensuring precise and consistent vessel widening, ideal for stenting. Compliant balloons fully expand to match the vessel's contours, accommodating varying diameters. Each type addresses specific clinical needs in coronary interventions.</p></p>
