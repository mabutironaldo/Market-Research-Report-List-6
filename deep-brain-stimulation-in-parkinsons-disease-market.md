<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson\'s Disease Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual Channel Deep brain Stimulator</li><li>Single Channel Deep brain Stimulator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's Disease primarily involves two types of stimulators: single-channel and dual-channel. A single-channel deep brain stimulator targets one specific area of the brain, offering a more straightforward approach for symptom management. In contrast, a dual-channel deep brain stimulator allows for stimulation of two different brain regions, providing enhanced flexibility and potentially more comprehensive symptom relief. Both types aim to alleviate motor symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients with Parkinson's Disease.</p></p>
