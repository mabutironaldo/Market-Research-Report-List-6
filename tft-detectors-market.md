<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TFT Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>TFT detectors in the medical imaging market are classified into two main types: indirect conversion and direct conversion. Indirect conversion detectors utilize a two-step process where X-rays are first converted into visible light, which is then detected by the thin-film transistor (TFT) array. In contrast, direct conversion detectors convert X-rays directly into electrical charges without the intermediate light stage. Each type has unique advantages, influencing applications in radiography and other imaging techniques based on sensitivity, resolution, and speed.</p></p>
