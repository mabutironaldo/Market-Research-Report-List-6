<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-end ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilation</li><li>Non-invasive Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The high-end ICU ventilators market is categorized into two main types: invasive and non-invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves the use of endotracheal tubes or tracheostomy to deliver air directly into the patient's lungs, providing essential support for severely compromised respiratory function. In contrast, non-invasive ventilation employs masks or nasal interfaces to assist breathing without invasive procedures, suitable for conditions like COPD or sleep apnea. Both types are crucial for managing critically ill patients in intensive care settings, enhancing survival and recovery.</p></p>
