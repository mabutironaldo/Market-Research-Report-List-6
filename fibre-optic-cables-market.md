<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fibre Optic Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-mode Optical Cable</li><li>Multimode Optical Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fiber optic cables market is primarily divided into two types: single-mode and multimode optical cables. Single-mode cables feature a small core diameter, allowing only one light mode to propagate, which results in higher bandwidth and longer transmission distances, making them ideal for telecommunications. In contrast, multimode cables have a larger core, enabling multiple light modes to travel simultaneously, which is suitable for shorter distances and local networks, often used in data centers and campus environments. Both play crucial roles in modern connectivity.</p></p>
