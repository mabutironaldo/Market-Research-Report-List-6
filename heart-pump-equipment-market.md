<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Pump Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Heart Pump Equipment</li><li>Extracorporeal Heart Pump Equipment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart pump equipment market is primarily divided into two types: implantable heart pump equipment and extracorporeal heart pump equipment. Implantable heart pumps, such as ventricular assist devices (VADs), are surgically placed within the body to support or replace failing heart function. Extracorporeal heart pumps, on the other hand, are used externally and temporarily assist the heart's function during surgeries or critical care situations. Both types play vital roles in managing heart conditions and improving patient outcomes.</p></p>
