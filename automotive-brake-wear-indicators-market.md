<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake Wear Indicators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrical Indicators</li><li>Audible Indicators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive brake wear indicators market features two main types: electrical indicators and audible indicators. Electrical indicators utilize sensors that monitor brake pad thickness and alert drivers through warning lights on the dashboard when replacement is needed. Audible indicators, on the other hand, use mechanical devices that produce a high-pitched sound when the brake pads wear down, signaling the driver to act. Both types enhance vehicle safety by providing timely warnings, thereby helping to prevent brake failure and ensuring proper maintenance.</p></p>
