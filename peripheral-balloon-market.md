<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Balloon Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PTA Balloon</li><li>DCB Balloon</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The peripheral balloon market encompasses two main types: PTA (Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty) balloons and DCB (Drug-Coated Balloons). PTA balloons are used to dilate narrowed blood vessels, enhancing blood flow during minimally invasive procedures. DCBs incorporate medication that inhibits restenosis, reducing the likelihood of vessel narrowing after angioplasty. Both types are essential in treating peripheral artery disease, as they improve patient outcomes by addressing vascular obstructions while minimizing potential complications associated with traditional stenting methods.</p></p>
